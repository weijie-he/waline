[Compute Nest](https://computenest.console.aliyun.com/) is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution Alibaba Cloud provides for service providers and their customers to manage services.

Service providers can publish private services on Compute Nest, and their customers can deploy these services easily. Service providers can also publish fully-managed services where they can implement hosted O&M for the resources of their customers.

Compute Nest provides service capabilities to cater to each stage of the lifecycle management of services. Service providers can manage different stages using different functional modules based on their requirements. This helps service providers improve operational efficiency, reduce operating costs, and provide simple and convenient services for customers.
